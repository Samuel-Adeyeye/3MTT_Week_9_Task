### Simple API using Node.js and Express.js

In this task, I created a simple API using Node.js and Express.js, featuring two main endpoints: a GET request to retrieve a list of users and a POST request to add new users. 

First, I set up the project environment using Node.js and npm, while Express.js was installed to build the server. The server listens on port 3000 and responds with a welcome message on accessing the root URL ("/"). The API endpoints were set up in a separate `users.js` file. The GET endpoint returns a list of curated users, and the POST endpoint accepts a user's name and email, adding them to the list after validation.

I implemented a simple Error-handling functionality to ensure that both required fields are present and return appropriate error messages for invalid requests. I integrated routes into the main `server.js` file and used JSON middleware to parse the request body.

I tested the app endpoints using Postman to ensure proper functionality and error handling. Potential improvements include adding a database for data persistence, integrating authentication, and deploying the server to a cloud platform for wider access. 

This task demonstrates the fundamentals of setting up a basic API with Node.js and Express.js.
